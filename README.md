# Glock9_Engine

The purpose of Glock9 Engine is to build an environment as flexible as Unreal Engine, but with little to no issues. This is why we are choosing Rust over C++, and later Go over Python. 

## Why we are choosing Go and Rust

Go is similar to Python, but is much faster and just as readable. We will use this language for gaming AI. Rust, on the other hand, is faster than C++ and provides several safety features that C and C++ are not capable of. There should be little to no excuse of encountering bugs unless we use the "unsafe" keyword, which we want to avoid.
